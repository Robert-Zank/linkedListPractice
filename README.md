## Description

The **Linked List Practice** project provides users with hands-on experience in implementing a linked list in Java. It includes fundamental operations such as adding, removing, and searching nodes, which helps users better understand the workings of linked lists and their practical applications in data structures.

### Features:
- Insert nodes at the beginning or end of the linked list.
- Remove nodes from the linked list.
- Search for nodes by value.
- Practice common operations of a singly linked list.
